# cluecon-2016

Hi!

The presentation I undertook at ClueCon 2016 was a distilled and cut-down (to fit to 25 minutes!) version of a workshop I did at the OpenSIPS 2016 Summit.

The full source code is available at https://github.com/petekelly/opensips-summit-2016 along with a description of how to setup the demo yourself. Please get in touch if you have any questions or comments.
